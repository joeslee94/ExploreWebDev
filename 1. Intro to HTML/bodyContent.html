    <h1>My Name!</h1>
    <p><i>
      Some descriptor of myself that is more fact than to establish credibility.
      In Italics to make sure that it is fancy. Very. Fancy.

      Apparently an em tag is better than the i tag!

    <p><b>
      This is a bold tag, but a strong tag conveys more information.

    <p><strong>
      So here is a strong tag to use what I am learning.

    <h2>My Bio!</h2>
    <p>
      In West Philadelphia born and raised playground is where I spent most of my days out. <br>
      Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school. <br>
      When a couple of guys, who we're up to no good started making trouble in my neighbourhood. <br>
      I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said, you're moving with your aunty and uncle in Bel-Air.
