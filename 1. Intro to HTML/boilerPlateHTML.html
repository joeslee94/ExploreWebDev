    <h1>What is a Boiler Plate?</h1>
    <p>It is a template skeleton for us to use so that we do not forget certain elements.</p>
    <p>I am sure those that coded long ago did not have these templates autopopulate.</p>

    <h3>Some Explanation for the Content</h3>
    <p>I wanted to create a short html page that holds information that Dr. Angela Yu goes over in her course!</p>
    <p>
      I can write about myself all day, but I do not think it'll be as good as LinkedIn or Microsoft Word in simply and beautifully summarizing my experiences.
      I do have an html resume, which I did long ago for class.

      <br>

      I may choose to revamp that as I get more proficient in web development.
      But for now I want to at least spend 20 hours this week going through HTML, CSS, and JS.
      I definitely want to focus on React as well.

    <h3>Another Heading Size 3</h3>
    <p>I do love articles like the following: <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/">Joel on Software</a></p>
    <p>This helps me focus in on the foundation and base knowledge from which to launch myself!</p>
    <ul>Background information
      <li>*This article if from '03'*</li>
      <li>UTF-8 is staying and not going anywhere</li>
      <li>Creating software that handles international input must be hard</li>
      <li>ASCII is 32 to 127 with a space being 32 "A" being 65 and "a" being 97</li>
      <li>This system worked so long as we spoke English</li>
      <li>128-255 were free real estate, so IBM, people from other countries, and anyone else took advantage</li>
      <li>So code pages were created to handle these differences BUT still limitations</li>
      <li>*Couldn't use s++ or s-- to iterate through a string, but rather Windows.AnsiNext and Prev*</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>Unicode
      <li>Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number</li>
      <li>Magic number example: U+0639 and is known as a code point</li>
      <li>"Hello" == U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F</li>
      <li>But how is this stored in memory? Or how is it supposed to be represented in an email?</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>Encodings
      <li>00 48 00 65 00 6C 00 6C 00 6F == 48 00 65 00 6C 00 6C 00 6F 00</li>
      <li>FE FF notations since there were two ways of storing Unicode</li>
      <li>That's where UTF-8 came in</li>
      <li>Bunch of ways to encode Unicode (some more outdated than others): UCS-2, UTF-16, FE/FF UCS-2, UCS-4, UTF-7 UTF-8</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>Closing Remarks
      <li>Makes no sense to have a string withou tknowing what encoding it uses</li>
      <li>There ain't no such thing as plain text</li>
      <li>As an example, must have this in the email to make it read correctly: Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"</li>
      <li>Overall need to make sure we are accounting for the encoding of the text we are receiving and sending</li>
    </ul>
